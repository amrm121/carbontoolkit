# carbontoolkit
Automated tool for vulnerability assessment

carbontoolkit is an automated tool created to assist during vulnerability assessment.
I suggest installing "The Penetration Testers Framework (PTF)" by trustedsec (https://github.com/trustedsec/ptf) to make sure that the tool works at its best. 
This is the first version; I will refine it, maybe adjusting the behavior of a few tools and adding new ones. I have prioritized a "not-so-aggressive" approach while creating it but I would like to add new tools, including for exploitation.
