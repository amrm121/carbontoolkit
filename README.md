# carbontoolkit
Automated tool for information gathering and vulnerability assessment

carbontoolkit is an automated tool created to assist during vulnerability assessment. It has been created to gather all the information needed for a preliminary vulnerability assessment.  
It was meant to be used privately and be highly customizable. As a consequence, there might still be a few issues to address. I will continue testing and fixing it so that any user can use carbontoolkit.  
I already provide Censys keys but I suggest tailoring carbontoolkit.conf for your personal needs.
